# Probability Theory @ Imperial College London
## Jointly written by [Ivan Kirev](https://github.com/ivankirev13) and [Samuel Lam](https://samuel-chlam.github.io)

This is the GitHub repository for an exposition of Probability Theory, written based on the lecture with the same name given at Imperial College London in spring 2022 by [Dr. Igor Krasovsky](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/i.krasovsky). This is an exposition with an excessive amount of motivations, examples and extra content, so if you only need a handbook for (last-minute) revision, you should read the following [notes by Jason Yi](https://github.com/JasonKYi/y3_notes/blob/main/Probability_Theory/Probability_Theory.pdf).

## Better preview
The following guide is written based on the [ICL Notes Organisation page](https://icl-notes.github.io/), made by Mayeul (Mike) Fournial.

You will need
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- A premium Overleaf account (at least on [standard plan](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans)). [Imperial provides a professional account for free](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/imperial).

### First steps: linking your GitHub account with your Overleaf account.
- Go to your [Overleaf account settings](https://www.overleaf.com/user/settings).
- Click on "Link to your GitHub account".
- Understand the access Overleaf requests, then click "Authorize Overleaf".

### Viewing an updated preview on Overleaf
- [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository).
- Import the repository into Overleaf:
    1. Go to your [projects page](https://www.overleaf.com/project).
    2. Click "New Project".
    3. From the drop-down menu, click "Import from GitHub".

At this point, you now have a full personal copy of the notes. Edit them in Overleaf as much as you want - all the changes will only affect you.

## Contributing
### Directly edit in Overleaf
Once you have an edit and you want to contribute back to the project:

- Open the Overleaf menu in the notes, and click on “GitHub” under “Sync”.
- Click on “Push Overleaf changes to GitHub” - you’ll be asked to provide a message explaining your changes. There are lots of guides online to writing good commit messages, but anything clear is fine.
- Click “Commit”.
- [Make a pull request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for the repository you want to edit.

### Raise a GitHub issue
Assuming you have a GitHub account,
- Go to the relevant repository (the full list is available here)
- Go to the issues tab and **try and see if there is an open issue that already exists for it in the list**. If so give it a thumbs up to tell the maintainer that it’s important!
- If no issue exists, create a new issue. Describe precisely what’s the problem to help the maintainer understand the necessary changes that he/she will have to do. You can include screenshots or even paste some LaTeX inside backticks quotes. **For anything longer than a paragraph, consider editing the existing notes straight away.**
