We have written this set of unofficial notes to facilitate your understanding of important concepts in Probability Theory. Although most parts of the notes are based the lecture videos and in-person lectures given by Dr. Igor Krasovsky in Spring 2022, we have included additional materials drawn from various references. In particular: 

\begin{unexaminable}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any unexaminable materials are highlighted using gray colorboxes.
\end{itemize}
\end{unexaminable}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any unfinished/planned materials are written in \red{red}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disclaimer.} These notes have not been checked by Dr. Krasovsky and should not be regarded as a replacement of the official notes and lectures for the course. In particular, all the errors are made by us, and we don't take any responsibility for their consequences; use at your own risk (and please do attend lectures -- they are fun). \\

Please email us at (insert email) with any comments or corrections.\\
