# Chapter breakdown

## Part I - Measure Theory and Random Variables
- All course materials above start in a similar way, so we do something similar and use the exposition as provided by [ICL] and [MIT].
- **(Planned material)** The exposition of subGaussian and subExponential variables will be based on Philippe Rigollet's lectures on high dimensional statistics, delivered in Spring 2017 at MIT. 

## Part II - Concepts of Convergence

### Chapter 4 - Coin Flips: Convergence in Probability
- Sections 4.1, 4.3 and some of the materials in section 4.2 are based on [ICL].
- Discussions regarding uniform integrability and triangular arrays are based on [MIT].
- **(Planned material)** Section 4.4 on further discussions about Poisson convergence will be based on [MIT].

### Chapter 5 - Weak Convergence
- Instead of following [ICL], we follow the approach from [MIT].
- Details of proof regarding Portmanteau theorems are based on the book [AK].
- Details of proof regarding Helly's selection theorems are based on [ICL] and [MIT].

### Chapter 6 - Characteristic Functions
- Sections 6.1- early 6.3 (before generalised version of CLT is introduced) follow closely with [ICL], with details of proofs filled out by [MIT].
- Later part of section 6.3 (Lindeberg-Feller theorem) follows [MIT].
- We follow [ICL] for section 6.5

### Chapter 7 - Almost sure convergence of random series
- Section 7.1 is common in all the resources, and 7.2 is written to aid your understanding.
- We follow a random series approach to prove SLLN, this is available in [RD]
- Section 7.4 follows the textbook of [ANS-2]
- Section 7.5 (Glivenko-Cantelli theorem) is written as part of my coursework on empirical processes.

## Part III - Foundations of Stochastic Analysis

### Chapter 8 - Conditioning and Disintegration
- Section 8.1 is a motivation of the idea, written based on [Oxford].
- Section 8.2-4 follows from a wide range of textbooks as introduced above.
- Section 8.5 is written based on [AK] to aid your understanding.

### (Planned material) Chapter 9 - Theory of Martingales
Advanced coursework 2021. 
Describe WLLN, SLLN, and CLT for a r.v.â€™s given by the Brownian motion
$B_{t_n}, n \in \mathbb{N}$, and a suitable quadratic function of the Brownian motion from the point of view of Martingales.

### (Planned material) Chapter 10 - An introduction to Markov Chains

### (Planned material) Chapter 11 - Ergodic Theory
Advanced coursework 2020.
